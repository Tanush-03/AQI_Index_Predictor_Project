# 🌫️ AQI Index Predictor | Python · EDA · Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using supervised machine learning models. It leverages historical pollutant data from multiple Indian cities to build accurate models and provide visual insights through Exploratory Data Analysis and city-wise trends.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Performed data cleaning and feature engineering on real-world AQI data.
- 📊 Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), including pollutant trends and correlation matrix.
- 🧠 Built and compared 3 ML models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
- 📈 Achieved **R² Score of 0.80+** with Random Forest.
- 🔍 Visualized **feature importance** and **city-wise AQI trends** interactively using `ipywidgets`.
